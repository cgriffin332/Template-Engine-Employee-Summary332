## Description

In this project I have created a command line application used to build a programming team based on user input that will then create an html file including the team roster. This application was built through test oriented programming using the npm package, jest. The user is prompted to answer a number of questions based on the type of employee being created, and does this with the npm package, inquirer.

## Installation

The user will need to clone the necesarry files from this project's GitHub repo, then run npm install in the terminal. Once that is finished, all that is left is to run the code "node app.js".

## Usage

Once the user has started the application by running "node app.js", they will be prompted to answer questions in the terminal.

Certain validations are set in place to insure that the users answers are acceptable.

Once the user finishes answering the manager questions, they are able to pick the next type of employee they would like to add to their team.

This process continues until the user decides that they no longer wish to add more employees.

An html file is then dynamically generated including each member of your new team.
